            <p>
              The idea for a football predictor stemmed from my brother, James,
              who started a mini-league among his friends during the Euros six
              years ago. We made predictions on match results and team
              qualifications, earning points for correct guesses, with a prize
              pool to keep things exciting.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Two years later, we repeated the experience for the World Cup. As
              a newly graduated computer science student, I attempted to build a
              website to manage the whole process. Underestimating the
              complexity, I ended up with a half-finished, basic-looking site
              that only lasted through the group stages.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward another two years, and with more web dev experience
              under my belt, I decided to expand on the original idea. As
              someone who likes a challenge, I set out to create a full-stack
              app where multiple leagues could coexist on a single site, with
              separate prediction rounds for the group and knockout stages.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, in the present day, after revisiting my code from two years
              ago, I've redesigned and re-architected everything, focusing on a
              simple, easy-to-use web app that can be served as a Progressive
              Web App (PWA) on your phone.
