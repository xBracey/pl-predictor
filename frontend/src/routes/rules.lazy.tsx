            Welcome to FootyBee, a World Cup 2022 football predictor where you
            can make predictions on games and create and join leagues with your
            friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The football predictor consists of two rounds, one for the group
            stages of the competition, and one for the knockout stages. Below is
            a summary for how you gain points for each round
          </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">Group Stage Rules</h2>
            <p>
              During the group stage, you can earn points based on the accuracy
              of your match predictions. The scoring system works as follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="flex flex-col gap-1 pl-3">
              <li>
                <b>Correct Score Prediction - 25 Points</b>
                <p>
                  If you predict the exact final score (e.g., 2-1), you'll earn
                  25 points.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Correct Score Margin (excluding draws) - 15 Points</b>
                <p>
                  If you predict the correct goal difference, but not the exact
                  score (e.g., you predict 1-0, and the match ends 2-1), you'll
                  earn 15 points. This does not apply to draw predictions.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Correct Draw Prediction - 10 Points</b>
                <p>
                  If you correctly predict a draw (e.g., 1-1 or 0-0), you'll
                  earn 10 points.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Correct Winner Prediction - 5 Points</b>
                <p>
                  If you predict the correct winning team, but not the exact
                  score (e.g., you predict 3-0, and the match ends 2-1), you'll
                  earn 5 points.
                </p>
              </li>

            <p>
              In the knockout stages, starting from the Round of 16 all the way
              to the Final, you'll be predicting which teams will advance
              through each round. Points are awarded cumulatively based on how
              far you accurately predict a team's progression. For each team,
              you'll earn points if you correctly predict their advancement to
              the next round, with higher points awarded for predicting deeper
              runs:
            </p>
